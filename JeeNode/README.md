RoboSphere
=
This group project was part of a 3rd-Year Engineering Project. Designed a ball-shaped sphere to immitate a robotic pet, moving in response to nearby external motion.
- Microcontrollers - Arduino Uno and JeeNode TX & RX 
- PIR Sensors to detect motion, Ultrasonic Sensor to help stop at certain or long distances
- Gyroscope Sensor to detect angular velocity, H-Bridge to control the spinning
- Unipolar Stepper Motors to drive the sphere forward, left, right with Adafruit Motor Shield
- Temperature Sensor to detect and transmit to a Liquid Crystal Display
